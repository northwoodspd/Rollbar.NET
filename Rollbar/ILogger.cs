    /// All the logging methods of this interface imply asynchronous/non-blocking implementation.
    /// However, the interface defines the method (ILogger AsBlockingLogger(TimeSpan timeout))
    /// that returns a synchronous implementation of ILogger.
    /// This approach allows for easier code refactoring when switching between 
    /// asynchronous and synchronous uses of the logger.
    /// 
    /// Normally, you would want to use asynchronous logging since it has virtually no instrumentation 
    /// overhead on your application execution performance at runtime. It has "fire and forget"
    /// approach to logging. However, in some specific situations, for example, while logging right before 
    /// exiting an application, you may want to use it synchronously so that the application
    /// does not quit before the logging completes.
